              distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its 
              layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a 
              more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
              'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
              Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
              Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will 
              uncover many web sites still in their infancy."
